        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>What is Bruschetta</h3>
        <p>Bruschetta (pronounced brew-SKET-tah) is an Italian appetizer or antipasti that starts with a base of toasted or grilled bread. 
            The bread is then served warm either with a topping spooned over or with a topping on the side so each person can 
            build their own bruschetta. Bruschetta is meant to be served as a hand-held finger food, large enough for one or two bites.</p>

        <h3>How do you make Bruschetta?</h3>
        <p>
            You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here are a few of our favorite tips for making the best bruschetta every time:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality counts:</strong> The beauty of a simple recipe like bruschetta is that it showcases the flavor of the 
                    individual ingredients. For this recipe, you can really taste the difference when you use ripe tomatoes and fresh (not dried) basil;
                     the best olive oil and balsamic vinegar you can afford, and hand-grated Parmesan cheese instead of pre-packaged grated cheese.</li>

                <li><strong>Add flavor with garlic: </strong> As an alternative to adding minced raw garlic to the tomato mixture, 
                    cut a peeled clove of garlic in half lengthwise and lightly rub the cut side over the slightly roughened 
                    surface of the toasted bread to impart a hint of garlic flavor. Rub on a little more garlic for a stronger flavor, 
                    if you wish. But watch out: A little garlic goes a long way.</li>

                <li><strong>Be patient:</strong> Make the tomato mixture and let it sit for a couple of hours so the flavors 
                    can develop more complexity. Yes, the tomatoes may give off a lot of juice as they marinate, but if you think 
                    the mixture is too juicy come serving time, simply use a slotted spoon to lift out the bruschetta topping as 
                    you spoon it over the bread. Don't toss the liquid, though — lots of people love to dip into it with extra bread. 
                    If you're going to top the bread first before serving, save that step until the last minute so the bread doesn't 
                    get soggy as it sits.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
